Hello group 7,

Your submission covers succinctly the workings of chord. I particularly liked how your group varied the read load on the system
by varying the no. of reads per minute. A minor area of improvement could be randomizing these parameters altogether using a third-party
statistical package.

Your grade for HW3 is 16%.

Comments:
+3% for the usage of typed Behaviors model for Akka actors.
+3% for a documenting your implementation and execution steps.

---

Your grade for the project is 17.5%.

-2%: For no evidence of deployment on an AWS EC2 instance.
-0.5%: I would have liked unit tests which simulate message passing between actors either synchronously or asynchronously.
